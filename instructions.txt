implement a golang application that connects to a tailscale network and act as a http/https load balancer to remote endpoints

this application should use:
- https://pkg.go.dev/tailscale.com/tsnet
- https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/labstack/echo/v4

it should route requests based on the host header

follow all best-practices and coding conventions, create tests where it makes sense

do *not* hallucinate, create a plan and validate each step before implementing, check everything before moving on
